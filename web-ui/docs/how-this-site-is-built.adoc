== How this site is built

Some visitors to ColeFitCorp.com may be interested in how this site has
been built. On this page I aim to explain how the site works in addition
to some key processes I followed when developing it.

=== System Architecture

On a high level, the Cole Fit Corp web application runs on several
servers owned and operated by Amazon Web Services (AWS for short).

This website can be broken up into three logical components. They
are:

- **The User Interface.** This is the component you are looking
  at right now. It supplies the static content of the site. Static
  content can be thought of as content that doesn't change -- it
  is the same for every user who visits the site and does not have
  to be computed in the background.
- **The Workout Service.** This component operates
  the colefitcorp.com/workouts page behind the scenes.
  It is currently responsible for receiving submitted workouts and responding
  to requests for these submitted workouts. However, this functionality
  could be extended if I have the time and will to do so.
- **The Database.** This components is where the submitted workouts are
  stored. As it is currently the sole source of truth for the list
  of workouts, it is imperative that the database be highly available and reliable.

I have created a series of diagrams that aim to explain the interplay
of the three ColeFit Corp web application components.

==== Diagram 1 - The Three Components

You'll see that the ColeFitCorp Web UI and the ColeFitCorp Workout
Service live in something called Docker Containers.

What is a Docker Container? On a high level, a Docker Container is a tool that simplifies
the application development and deployment processes. In specific, Docker Containers
do the following for me:

- **Isolate processes that are running on the same server.** This
  enables the cfcorp-web-ui and cfcorp-workout-service to just worry
  about "themselves" as opposed to worrying about "themselves and
  everything else on the server".
- **Standardize the environment where each application is run.**
  Environment standardization allows me to have confidence that whatever
  I built on my own computer (also called my "local") will run as
  intended on any other computer. When I build an application on
  my local, I am building it using my local's operating environment.
  When I have finished building and am ready to ship my product
  to a server, I am basically sending the code that I developed on my local
  to a computer somewhere in the cloud. Without a containerization
  service such as Docker, there can be no promises made about how
  the application will run on a different computer. However, if I put my application
  in a Docker Container, it will run as intended in any environment that
  can run the Docker Container. This guarantee saves me a lot of
  headaches. Especially when I have a product finished on my local
  and am eager to see it run in production!

I am being intentionally vague about this "Database-as-a-service" shown
in the diagram above. For now, it can be thought of as a "reliable, available place
to store the application data". I'll explain it in more detail in subsequent diagrams.
