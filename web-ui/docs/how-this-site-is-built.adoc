== How this site is built

Some visitors to ColeFitCorp.com may be interested in how this site has
been built. On this page I aim to explain how the site works in addition
to some processes I followed when developing it.

=== System Architecture

This website can be broken up into three logical components. They
are:

1. **The User Interface.** This is the component you are looking
  at right now. It supplies the content of the site.
  {nbsp} +
  The site has two different kinds of content: **static content** and **dynamic content**.
  ** **Static content** can be thought of as content that is the same for all users,
  all the time -- it does not have to be fetched or computed in the background.
  Static content is hardcoded into the UI.
  The following pages are completely static:
    *** colefitcorp.com
    *** colefitcorp.com/pricing
    *** colefitcorp.com/testimonials
    *** colefitcorp.com/blog (this page)
  ** **Dynamic content** changes between users or throughout time. It cannot be
  hardcoded into the UI. Instead, I have created a UI template for dynamic
  content which formats the dynamic data upon fetching it.
    *** The only dynamically generated page is colefitcorp.com/workouts. The
    content of this page changes throughout time as workouts are continually added.

2. **The Workout Service.** This component supplies the dynamic functionality for
  the colefitcorp.com/workouts page. It is responsible for receiving submitted
  workouts and responding to requests for these submitted workouts.
3. **The Database.** This component is where the submitted workouts are
  stored.

I have created a series of diagrams that aim to explain the interplay
of the three ColeFit Corp web application components.

==== Diagram 1 - The Three Components

Nothing crazy in this diagram. Above are the three components as described.

The "User Interface" and "Workout Service" both run in Docker containers on the same
EC2 instance. These containers are aptly named "cfcorp-web-ui" and "cfcorp-workout-service".

Docker is a tool that greatly simplifies my application development
and deployment processes. It makes it easier for me to build applications that
will run on any server. In specific, Docker does the
following for me:

- **Isolates processes that are running on the same server.** This
  enables the cfcorp-web-ui and cfcorp-workout-service to just worry
  about "themselves" as opposed to worrying about "themselves and
  everything else on the server". Docker protects each application from
  its surroundings -- all the other junk going on in the server unrelated
  to the application itself.
- **Standardizes the environment where each application is run.**
  Docker's environment standardization allows me to have confidence that my applications
  will run as intended on any machine that can run Docker. When I build an
  application on my local, I am building it using my local's operating environment.
  Without a containerization service such as Docker, there can be no promises made
  about how the locally built application will run in a different environment.
  What if the application has a dependency on a local package?
  What if it needs a configuration file that only exists on my local?
  Local Libraries? Local System tools? The list goes on and on.
  Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains
  everything the software needs to run. No dependencies on the world outside of
  the container. This means that the Dockerized software can run as intended
  in any environment that can run Docker -- no assembly required! This guarantee
  saves me a lot of headaches. Especially when I have a product finished on my local
  and am eager to see it run in production.

I am being intentionally vague about this "Database-as-a-service" shown
in the diagram above. For now, it can be thought of as a "reliable, available place
to store the application data". I'll explain it in more detail in subsequent diagrams.

==== Diagram 2 - Call flow

image::https://github.com/dhvogel/ColeFitCorp-applications/raw/master/web-ui/src/public/assets/images/cfcorp_architecture-2.png[width=75%]

This diagram shows how the three components interact with each other. You'll see
both the server and Docker Containers now have ports defined. Ports are what
machines use to talk to each other over the internet.

Why did I choose to expose port 80 on the server? Because port 80 is the __default HTTP port__.
When you make an HTTP request to a server without specifying a port, your request will
automatically get forwarded to port 80 on that server. So, when you say "I want to
go to http://colefitcorp.com ", what you are really saying is "I want to go to
http://colefitcorp.com:80 ". Why is 80 the default port? Pretty interesting story.
You can read about it https://superuser.com/a/996843[here].

When a request comes in to port 80 on my server, it gets forwarded to port 3000
on the CFCorp-web-ui container, where the application is listening.
This relationship is called a **port mapping**.
An additional port mapping is defined between the server port 9000 and the
CFCorp-workout-service container port 9000. So, when CFCorp-web-ui needs to talk
to CFCorp-workout-service, it can make a call out to the same server that it
sits on, just at a different port.

[underline]#**A story about service discovery**#

OK, easy enough. In order to get this call to work, all I need to do is make a call
to http://<hostname>:9000. When I develop locally, I spin up the CFCorp-web-ui and
CFCorp-workout-service containers on localhost. My call to the CFCorp-workout-service
is a simple as calling http://localhost:9000. And voila, it works! Let's ship it!

So I ship it. And lo and behold, when I visit http://colefitcorp.com/workouts,
the site tells me that it can't connect to
http://localhost:9000. Huh? Wasn't I just able to do that?

The piece that I was missing is that while I was hitting the production server
when I visited the site, the site code was still being executed on the __client__ side.
So when I tried to call http://localhost:9000, it was my **local** making that call,
not the server. Of course, I had nothing running at my local's http://localhost:9000 at the time, so
the call failed. (Except sometimes I did leave my local service up in the background,
which really through me for a loop as my calls sometimes succeeded and sometimes
failed. Drove me pretty nuts for a while).

How could I fix this? Well, one solution is instead of calling localhost, I could
explicitly call the server's IP address. So instead of calling http://localhost:9000,
I could call http://<server-ip>:9000. Sounds easy enough.

**Question for the audience:** How can I know my eventual production server's
IP Address when I am developing the application?

**Answer:** I can't. Sad!

When I ask AWS to spin up a server for me to use in production, I am letting them
choose which one of their seemingly-infinite amount of servers they want to spin
up for me. This means that I can't possibly predict the eventual server's IP.
Yes, it is possible to rent a specific server from Amazon but that's more
expensive and I ain't made of money.

This problem of "how do I know where to contact the cfcorp-workout-service without
hardcoding in the IP of the server" is actually a pretty big one that people have thought
a lot about. It is a field generally called **service discovery** and there are several
tools available that can do exactly what I need. I won't go into the details of these
tools -- I just wanted to call out the fact that keeping track of the services
in this system is harder than might first appear.
