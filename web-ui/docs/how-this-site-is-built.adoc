== How this site is built

Some visitors to ColeFitCorp.com may be interested in how this site has
been built. On this page I aim to explain how the site works in addition
to some key processes I followed when developing it.

=== System Architecture

On a high level, the Cole Fit Corp web application runs on several
servers owned and operated by Amazon Web Services (AWS for short).

This website can be broken up into three logical components. They
are:

- **The User Interface.** This is the component you are looking
  at right now. It supplies the static content of the site. Static
  content can be thought of as content that doesn't change -- it
  is the same for every user who visits the site and does not have
  to be computed in the background.
- **The Workout Service.** This component operates
  the colefitcorp.com/workouts page behind the scenes.
  It is currently responsible for receiving submitted workouts and responding
  to requests for these submitted workouts. However, this functionality
  could be extended if I have the time and will to do so.
- **The Database.** This component is where the submitted workouts are
  stored. As it is currently the sole source of truth for the list
  of workouts, it is imperative that the database be highly available and reliable.

I have created a series of diagrams that aim to explain the interplay
of the three ColeFit Corp web application components.

==== Diagram 1 - The Three Components

In this diagram, we have two applications (the blue boxes) running on a server
owned by Amazon (the orange box).

I am calling the two applications "CFCorp-web-ui" and "CFCorp-workout-service". Aptly
named as they are, they correspond to the "User Interface" and "Workout Service"
mentioned above.

Astute readers will notice that these two applications live in something called "Docker
Containers". What is a Docker Container? On a high level, a Docker Container is a tool that simplifies
the application development and deployment processes. It makes it easier for me to build
applications that will run on any server. In specific, Docker Containers do the
following for me:

- **Isolate processes that are running on the same server.** This
  enables the cfcorp-web-ui and cfcorp-workout-service to just worry
  about "themselves" as opposed to worrying about "themselves and
  everything else on the server".
- **Standardize the environment where each application is run.**
  Environment standardization allows me to have confidence that whatever
  I built on my own computer (also called my "local") will run as
  intended on any other computer. When I build an application on
  my local, I am building it using my local's operating environment.
  When I have finished building and am ready to ship my product
  to a server, I am basically sending the code that I developed on my local
  to a computer somewhere in the cloud. Without a containerization
  service such as Docker, there can be no promises made about how
  the application will run on a different computer. However, if I put my application
  in a Docker Container, it will run as intended in any environment that
  can run the Docker Container. This guarantee saves me a lot of
  headaches. Especially when I have a product finished on my local
  and am eager to see it run in production!

I am being intentionally vague about this "Database-as-a-service" shown
in the diagram above. For now, it can be thought of as a "reliable, available place
to store the application data". I'll explain it in more detail in subsequent diagrams.

==== Diagram 2 - Call flow

This diagram shows how the three components interact with each other. You'll see
both the server and Docker Containers now have ports defined. Ports are what
machines use to talk to each other over the internet.

Why did I choose to expose port 80 on the server? Because port 80 is the __default HTTP port__.
When you make an HTTP request to a server without specifying a port, your request will
automatically get forwarded to port 80 on that server. So, when you say "I want to
go to http://colefitcorp.com ", what you are really saying is "I want to go to
http://colefitcorp.com:80 ". Why is 80 the default port? Pretty interesting story.
You can read about it https://superuser.com/a/996843[here].

When a request comes in to port 80 on my server, it gets forwarded to port 3000
on the CFCorp-web-ui container, where the application is listening.
This relationship is called a __port mapping__.
An additional port mapping is defined between the server port 9000 and the
CFCorp-workout-service container port 9000. So, when CFCorp-web-ui needs to talk
to CFCorp-workout-service, it just makes a call out to the same server that it
sits on, just at a different port.

OK, easy enough. In order to get this call to work, all I need to do is make a call
to http://<hostname>:9000. When I develop locally, I spin up the CFCorp-web-ui and
CFCorp-workout-service containers on my local host, which is aptly named "localhost".
My call to the CFCorp-workout-service is a simple as calling http://localhost:9000.
And it works! Let's ship it!

So I ship it. And lo and behold, when I visit http://colefitcorp.com/workouts,
the site tells me that it can't connect to
http://localhost:9000. Huh? Wasn't I just able to do that?

The piece that I was missing is that while I was hitting the production server
when I visited the site, the code was still being executed on the __client__ side.
When I visited http://colefitcorp.com, in the background, my local requested the
site content from the server and displayed it to me. So when I tried to call
http://localhost:9000, it was my local making that call, **not** the server. Of
course, I had nothing running at my local's http://localhost:9000 at the time, so
the call failed. (Except sometimes I did leave my local service up in the background,
which really through me for a loop as my calls sometimes succeeded and sometimes
failed).

How could I fix this? Well, instead of calling localhost, I could explicitly call
the server's IP address. So instead of calling http://localhost:9000, I could call
http://<server-ip>:9000. Sounds easy enough.

**Question for the audience:** How can I know my eventual production server's
IP Address when I am developing the application?

Answer: I can't. Sad!

When I ask AWS to spin up a server for me to use in production, I am letting them
choose which one of their seemingly-infinite amount of servers they want to spin
up for me. This means that I can't possibly predict the eventual server's IP.
Yes, it is possible to rent a specific server from Amazon but that's more
expensive and I ain't made of money.

In a production environment, I will have to bake in some mechanism
for the application to discover the IP address of the server upon which it lives
at runtime. Using this newly discovered IP, I can be sure the CFCorp-web-ui is hitting
http://<the-server>:9000 and not http://<our-local>:9000. (In a local environment
I can keep it as http://localhost:9000). Problem solved!
